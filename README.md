## About me
Hi there! I'm Gabriele, a PhD student from Italy. I received my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the Politecnico di Torino in 2022. After more than an year working as a Deep Learning Research Engineer I decided to start a PhD; currently I'm pursuing a PhD in Deep Learning, as a result of a joint collaboration between the Politecnico di Torino and the European Space Agency (ESA), within the Open Space Innovation Platform (OSIP) Framework. 
My main research interests include computer vision, representation learning, remote sensing and much more!
